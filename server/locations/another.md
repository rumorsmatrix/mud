Surrounding the arena bones is the city of Rooksfoot. Once devastated by the battle with the Lost Avatar, the town is now a prosperous hub, thriving on the blood and avarice of the adventurers that come to test their mettle. The large population is mainly human, though there is a small elven community who, to no-one's surprise, largely keep to themselves but nonetheless wield some political power. Likewise, pockets of dwarven industry are present, though they are far more integrated into the life of the town, especially wherever gold is earned and ale is poured.

This is another location, linked to [the first one](?move=start).
